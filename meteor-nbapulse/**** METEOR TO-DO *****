**** METEOR TO-DO *****

BUGS
-----------------------------

[X] GamesMenu - Selected game is not displaying as selected. Probably issue with condition of when to render() and this.props.gameSelected passed.

[ ] StatsControl - Selecting/Unselecting stats doesn't work currently. It will deselect from the player card but not from the cord visualization

[ ] GamesMenu - When selecting a game that hasn't been played the whole site fails. Something should be displayed saying that the game is not yet available or hasn't been played instead of crashing.



MAIN/OVERALL IMPROVEMENTS
-----------------------------
[ ] Have a spinner overlay for when the data is being loaded.



GAME DETAILS/MENU
-----------------------------
[X] Update player selection for the game. Right now the selection is done by position in array of team players. The player list to create chart is a dictionary. Selection does not work.

[X] Deselecting a player is not working. Need to be remove it from the array of each team.

[ ] Add date and location information like Arena, City, etc. 

[ ] Add records of teams at that point in the calendar.

[ ] In the Team Players List, only show the players that played in that game?
	* Maybe show all the players that have played for the team but have the ones that didn't play as disabled.




GAME VISUALIZATION
-----------------------------
[ ] Have an empty cord chart if the player DNP. Right now the player will not show up because there is not player data in the playerLog for that game.

[ ] Add a time scale at the top of the visualization so users have an idea of what the cord sections are.


CHARTS 
-----------------------------
[ ] Remove player/team card from Chart components. It should be a component by itself.




DATA
-----------------------------
[X] Add substitution data to the Game Data on the DB. Substitution Data is currently not processed on the server when a game is loaded for the first time.
