*** TO DO ***


------- Game Menu -------
[X] Add game list for each team when selecting
[ ] Add color scheme for W/L in each game
[ ] Games go over to multiple lines. Find a different way to show all of them, maybe horizontal scroll.
[ ] 


------- Game Details --------
[X] Add Game scores and Game details
[X] Add quarter by quarter score breakdown
[ ] Improve player list selection instead of the orange blocks
[ ] 



------- Player Details ------

[ ] Take out player card from chart component. Those two should be independent of each other
[X] Create player card with photo, position, game stats.
[ ] Add team colors to player card to differentiate them.




------- Substitutions ------

[ ] Make substitutions display per quarter only and make sure to check if player has an event in the quarter. That way it will remove the issue with player shown on bench but actually played the entire quarter.
[ ] Set the description for "bench" moment using the subbed out play description. Or add a legend for bench (?).
[ ] BUG: Fix whenever the player played for the whole quarter. Right now it displays as if didn't.
[ ] BUG: There might be some weird case when the player was subbed out but the substitution is not displayed or in the data (maybe?).


------- String Chart -------
[X] Add substitution/on court display in the String Chart
[X] Fix quarter size based on number of moments. It is creating the OTs with the same size as a regular quarter.



-------- Scoring Chart ----------
[X] Make the axis lines display behind the scoring path but the axis numbers should be on top of it.
[ ] Add a x,y grid line on hover so the user can know the exact scoring margin at a specific moment by hovering over it. 
[ ] Add the score on a pop out (maybe?) <--- test it



-------- Hot/Cold Streak Chart ----------
Desc: A chart that will display the good/bad shooting streak of a player depending on his misses or makes in a row. 
- Could be displayed beneath the shooting cords but instead of the rest of the cords selected. 
- Also something as simple as a bar chart up or down but only counts makes in a row.
- Color code it to show hotness (red scale) or coldness (blue scale).

-------- Multi Game/Series Scoring ----------
[ ] Select the maximum scoring margin for the whole series and use that as the range for every game so they are better to compare to each other



-------- BACK END ----------
[ ] Add the DB to save game data
[ ] Create API end points to handle all queries (Python Flasks or Meteor?)
[ ] Create procedure that will automatically download the latest game data
