*** TO DO ***


[ ]  Add substitution/on court display in the String Chart


------- Substitutions ------

[ ]  Handle when the player is on the court at the end of the game
[ ]  Hanled when the player is subbed in during a quarter break
		* The log has no registry of this cases (might have to be manual)
		* This happens when there is a 'sub-out' when it was on the beanch
		* Doesn't necessarilly mean that the player got subbed in in the previous qtr break
		





-------- Scoring Chart ----------
[ ] Make the axis lines display behind the scoring path but the axis numbers should be on top of it.




-------- Series Scoring ----------
[ ] Select the maximum scoring margin for the whole series and use that as the range for every game so they are better to compare to each other
